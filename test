Lysosomes : Lysosomes can be considered as dismantling and restructuring units of a cell.

The enzymes in lysosomes are used by most eukaryotic cells to digest  macromolecules.

The lysosomal enzymes show optimal activity in acidic pH. Lysosomes arise from Golgi associated endoplasmic reticulum.

The list of lysosomal enzymes includes all types of hydro lases viz, amylases, proteases and lipases.

After the action of enzymes is over, the lysosome is reformed and re used.

Lysosomes are thus found in various structural forms and carry out various functions for the cell.

Residual body is the vesicle containing undigested remains left over in the heterophagic vesicle after releasing the products of digestion in the cytosol.

Lysosomes which bring about digestion of cells own organic material like a damaged cell organelle, are called autophagic vesicles .

An autophagic vesicle essentially consists of lysosome fused with membrane bound old cell organelle or organic molecules to be recycled.

Remember, every week, a human liver cell recycles half of its macromolecules.

Lysosomes bring about intracellular and extracellular digestion.

The intracellular digestion is brought about by autophagic vesicle or secondary lysosomes which contain foreign materials brought in by processes like phagocytosis.

Always Remember Lysosomal enzymes do not digest their own membrane proteins.

Three dimensional shape of these proteins probably protects the membrane.

Accidental release of lysosomal enzymes in limited amount does not harm the cell because pH of cytosol is near neutral.

Any insufficiency in secretion of lysosomal enzymes leads to disorders e.g. in genetic disorder, Tey Sach's disease, due to insufficiency of lipase, brain gets impaired due to accumulation of fats.

Extracellular digestion is brought about by release of lysosomal enzymes outside the cell.

During metamorphosis process found in many organisms, lysosomal enzymes help in reusing the tissues of redundant organs.
