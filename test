Chloroplasts contain green pigment  chlorophyll along with other enzymes that help in production of sugar by photosynthesis.

Inner membrane of double walled chlorophyll is comparatively less permeable.

Inside the cavity of inner membrane, there is another set of membranous sacs called thylakoids.

Thylakoids are arranged in the form of stacks called grana .

The grana are connected to each other by means of membranous tubules called stroma lamellae.

Space outside thylakoids is is filled with stroma.

The stroma, and the space inside thylakoids contain various enzymes essential for photosynthesis.
